# mostly markdown blog
This code hosts [my blog](https://github.com/nikolay-labs/blog). The project is an endevaour to turn a folder of markdown files, some css and three html files - index, header and footer into a blog!

The heavy lifting is done by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Some future work _might_ be done to add some missing features.
