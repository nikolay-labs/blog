# mostly markdown blog
This code is [my blog](https://github.com/nikolay-labs/blog). Note to self:

To add a post:
1. write post into the md directory
2. add a `<li>` tag referencing the md fileanme (change extension to html) to `index.html` 

all the work is done by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

## future work
- [ ] rss feed (does anyone use these???)
- [ ] search
- [ ] tags
